<h1>Online Job Recruitment System</h1>
The job recruitment portal is a computerised system that helps remove the hassle of job 
appointment. It acts as an interface between the job seekers and the companies also has a facility of 
admin login through which the admin can monitor the whole system. The admin has the power of 
approving the companies or rejecting it and the admin can see the list of verified companies. The
companyâ€™s user can add vacancies and receive the applications of the job seekers and approve them 
for interview or for company visit. The job seeker can see the available companies with a vacancy
and they can apply for the interview or company bistate can also see the current affairs on their 
dashboard. Overall, this project of ours is being developed to help the job applicants as well the 
companies to interact in the best way possible and reduce the human efforts.
